# Java Chatbot Project

## Overview

This Java chatbot is designed to interact with users through a series of prompts and responses. It tests the user's knowledge about Java programming, guesses their age, tells a story about the user, and provides a fun fact about each day of the week.

## Features

- Greets the user.
- Asks the user to repeat their name.
- Guesses the user's age using a binary search method.
- Counts up to a number specified by the user.
- Tests the user's programming knowledge with a multiple-choice question.
- Tells a story about the user based on their name and age.
